Task 2: Walking Algorithm for Humanoid Robot

Walking Algorithm Steps:
Initialize Position

Set all servos (hip, knee, ankle) to a neutral standing position (90째).

Shift Weight

Slightly move the upper body to one side (e.g., shift center of mass over left leg) to prepare to lift the right leg.

Lift Leg

Raise the right leg by rotating the right hip servo forward (~60째) and bend the right knee servo (~120째).

Move Leg Forward

Extend the right leg forward (hip servo back to ~90째) while straightening the knee servo to prepare for the step.

Place Foot Down

Gently lower the right leg and return the weight back to the center.

Repeat for Left Leg

Shift body weight to the right leg, and repeat the same steps for the left leg.

Loop

Repeat steps 2 to 6 to continue walking.
