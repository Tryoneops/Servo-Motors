# Servo-Motors
## Humanoid Robot Servo Programming and Walking Algorithm

### Task 1: Servo Motor Control
We programmed 4 servo motors using Arduino to perform the following:
- Sweep back and forth using the built-in Arduino "Sweep" example for 2 seconds.
- Then, all servos automatically hold position at 90Â° (neutral stance).

### Task 2: Walking Algorithm
We designed a basic walking algorithm for a humanoid robot. It simulates bipedal movement by shifting weight and alternating leg movements using servo-controlled joints (hip and knee). This lays the foundation for future implementation and real-world testing of robotic locomotion.
